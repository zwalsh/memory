6. Is your game properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?

7. How did you handle cards flipping back after a set timeout?
When two cards become visible, the server uses the
:timer Erlang module to schedule a function call that hides
all the cards and broadcasts the result to everyone listening
on the topic. This is how all changes happen, so multiple people
could be in the same room at the same time, which means data 
races are possible. It seemed better than keeping state
on the channel, though.
